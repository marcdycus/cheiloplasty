pseudo code for star wars



on start click
reset values and locations of images

on character click 
if first click = false
    asign to new locations 
    make first click = true
    push number to empty variable
else if first click = true,
    asign to new locations 
    push number to empty variable
    make second choice = true


else return false


on attack click
if second choice = true
    check variable integers to see if you win. 
    if player number > 0,
        take the two variables and subtract amounts from them ***********(define in more detail)
        subtract attack from both characters
        add attack power +6
    if enemy value <= 0 
        move him to display none, 
        make second click == false
    else if player number <=0 
        reset values and you lose

else return false


somewhere in attack is essentially like the equals button and 

to select an id within a div $(id div).on(click)


if
